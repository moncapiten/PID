
FOLDER: IV-T_dependendence_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS contain the files for each data pull at each temperature, both forward and reverse in voltage( description of the columns is present inside each file)
    each folder also contains a log.txt file with timestamped logs from the program to follow the progress live and be able to reference in case the need should arise

FILE: IV_T[TT.TT]_V[MIN]_[MAX]_[n]Pull_T[DIR]
    - TT.TT is temperature at which the specific measurement was taken
    - MIN and MAX are the extremes of the applied voltage
    - n is the pull number 0-indexed
    - DIR can be either Go or Return, if we are in the increasing or decreasing temperature arm

IV-T_dependence_20250404_100546 - PN diode
IV-T_dependence_20250408_110423 - Schottky diode
IV-T_dependence_20250408_124236 - 1st Zener diode
IV-T_dependence_20250411_094932 - 2nd Zener diode
IV-T_dependence_20250414_092701 - PN diode long take
IV-T_dependence_20250415_113544 - Schottky diode long take


There's also files with a single IV take at room temperature in case of need.
